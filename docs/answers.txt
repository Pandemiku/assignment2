I went through the git lab tutorial on 10/15/2021
September 2021
1. [master e432dc8] Created docs/status.txt to hold the result of git status
 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 docsstatus.txt
2. 14, git log
3. I modified it on on  Date:   Fri Oct 15 17:31:35 2021 -0500, but someone else created it on  
Date:   Wed Sep 25 18:33:08 2019 -0400
4. Branches are cheap and easy to create, and also allow for a streamlined process of editing
5. git log shows the evolution of project files, status shows what could be added before a commit would
make sense to use
6. $ git log --follow Vehicle.h
7. git log | grep file
8. (I) Inheritance can be used is when you derive a class from another class, like using the class 
strawberry extending to the class fruit. (II) Polymorphism is the idea of using different objects in the 
same framework, in the instance of a derived class. This is like using the name Rectangle in the place ofshape, since it is a shape. (III) Encapsulation, as the name implies, is like wrapping the code that will
work on data together with the data.
9. The main difference between the two is the direct contact between developers and the highest level,
with Dictator and Luitenants having a middle man between the developers and highest level. 
10. The dictator would have less direct contacts with as many people, as the luitenants can direct workflow to the dictator as sees fit.
